Prof. Jones,

I have been having severe complications with my VM lately, and the issues isn't within the VM itself. I seldom get sandbox open, even if I do the "Connect to Remote Console" does nothing and remote desktop just fails out. I feel like I am running out of options. Any suggestions?

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Mr. Jones,

I apologize for contacting you so abruptly however my virtual machine got a blue screen and is now not responding or allowing me to log on. It seems to be stuck on the bootup screen and I wanted to seek your guidance before I accidentally dump the information from my machine in some accident.

Thanks for the help,

David Schneider
